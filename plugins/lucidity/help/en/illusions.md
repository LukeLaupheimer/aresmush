# Illusions

Illusions are how players can superimpose their dream logic in another person's dreamscape. Illusions are expensive. The illusion persists until people write a certain number of unique words in following scenes. When the illusion evaporates, a special message can be sent to the people in the room detailing what happens as it reverts back. The two most noteworthy commands are:

## Commands

illusion/impose <new description> -- Set the imposition description
illusion/evaporation <message>    -- Set the evaporation message

## Acceptable Use

Do not use this to completely remove other people's rooms. You are free to fundamentally alter them, like if you are a cat envisioning herself as a literal divinity you might want to turn Lain's wires into yarn or her bathroom into a giant litter box, but you wouldn't want to do something out of character or something that just completely erases the other room.
