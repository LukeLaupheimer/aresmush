    [1;34mYou Are Responsible For What You Transmit

    [0;37mPlease don't transmit anything obnoxious, because if it gets bad
    [0;37menough, banning you might become necessary. While we are in favor of a
    [3;37mlaissez faire[0;37m culture, there are limits. Try not to push them too far.

    [0;37mDefinitely don't transmit anything that is illegal under United States
    [0;37mLaw. We won't hesitate to cooperate with authorities if you end up
    [0;37musing this service for anything illegal under United States Law.

    [1;34mWe Are Responsible For Nothing

    [0;37mBy going farther, you agree that anything you are exposed to here is
    [0;37myour own responsibility. We are not here to babysit you, so that
    [0;37maforementioned [3;37mlaissez faire[0;37m culture might mean you read something that
    [0;37moffends you. It might even offend us. We generally don't regard this
    [0;37mas a very good reason to ban or consequence people.

    [1;34mBe Creative, Have Fun, and Be Fun

    [0;37mIn spite of how harsh the first two things might sound, we would much
    [0;37mprefer to have creative but pain in the ass players than
    [0;37measily-managed but boring players. Things only seem ridiculous before
    [0;37mthey've been done before. Do something neat and even forbidden.
    [0;37mPlay along with other users, but don't be a cog or a pushover. By
    [0;37mgoing further, you agree to create something clever, to make your
    [0;37mpresence known, to, simply put, pull some shit. In character, of
    [0;37mcourse. Try to keep out of character drama to a minimum.
