By playing here, you must adhere to these terms of service:

    [1;34mYou Are Responsible For What You Transmit

    [0mPlease don't transmit anything obnoxious, because if it gets bad
    [0menough, banning you might become necessary. While we are in favor of a
    [0mlaissez faire[0m culture, there are limits. Try not to push them too far.

    [0mDefinitely don't transmit anything that is illegal under United States
    [0mLaw. We won't hesitate to cooperate with authorities if you end up
    [0musing this service for anything illegal under United States Law.

    [1;34mWe Are Responsible For Nothing

    [0mBy going farther, you agree that anything you are exposed to here is
    [0myour own responsibility. We are not here to babysit you, so that
    [0maforementioned [0mlaissez faire[0m culture might mean you read something that
    [0moffends you. It might even offend us. We generally don't regard this
    [0mas a very good reason to ban or consequence people.

    [1;34mBe Creative, Have Fun, and Be Fun

    [0mIn spite of how harsh the first two things might sound, we would much
    [0mprefer to have creative but pain in the ass players than
    [0measily-managed but boring players. Things only seem ridiculous before
    [0mthey've been done before. Do something neat and even forbidden.
    [0mPlay along with other users, but don't be a cog or a pushover. By
    [0mgoing further, you agree to create something clever, to make your
    [0mpresence known, to, simply put, pull some shit. In character, of
    [0mcourse. Try to keep out of character drama to a minimum.
